Update (Sep 2025) — Alignment with working demo

- Product/CLI naming: SecuraMem (smem). Mentions of CodeContextPro/cctx below refer to the same system; keep historical sections for provenance.
- Current CLI surface: remember, recall, status, vector-status, self-test, init, index-code, search-code, reindex-file, policy, prove-offline, report, export-context, import-context, pro.
- Audit viewing: use smem report --json (journal/receipt-show are not exposed as separate commands in the current CLI build).
- Windows native vector backend: sqlite-vec vec0.dll is auto-detected from either .securamem/sqlite-vec/win32-x64/vec0.dll or node_modules/sqlite-vec-windows-x64/vec0.dll; otherwise the loader falls back to local-js.
- Air-gapped models: pre-cache @xenova/transformers model files under .securamem/models via an offline bootstrap script; prove with smem prove-offline.
- Quick commands: smem status; smem vector-status; smem report --json; smem index-code --path .; smem search-code "SymbolName".

Executive Summary
CodeContextPro (cctx) is a context infrastructure tool with Developer Parity: anything the agent does is transparent, reproducible, and verifiable by a human. We led with Agent Transparency & Operator Parity, then hardened zero‑trust + air‑gapped context integrity. Advanced semantic recall (Tree‑sitter + ANN) is the next performance leap. Sequence: build trust first → deliver durable recall → accelerate performance for power users.

Immediate priorities (original memory‑only scope) & STATUS:
1) Agent Transparency & Operator Parity ✅ (trace / dry‑run / receipts / journal / plan+mirror)
2) Code‑aware hybrid recall ▶ (baseline hybrid rerank shipped; Tree‑sitter + ANN pending)
3) Zero‑Trust policy enforcement ✅ (allow-command/path, trust tokens, doctor, network guard)
4) Air‑Gapped Context (.cctxctx) ✅ (signing, zip, per‑file checksums, provenance, exit codes)
5) Context Replay ⏳ (kept minimal until after public launch)

Additional delivered items:
6) Import exit codes: 2 unsigned blocked, 3 invalid signature, 4 checksum mismatch ✅
7) Key management: rotate, status, archive, list, prune ✅
8) Path redaction guard in receipts ✅
9) Zipped export + checksums.json + exporter provenance ✅
10) Key archive groundwork (multi-key verification pending) ✅

This sequencing eliminated the "AI black box" criticism and made CodeContextPro safe and intuitive for both AI agents and developers—establishing trust before advanced recall.

Recommendations and Design Notes (historical + updated where marked)
1) Agent Transparency & Operator Parity (Sprint 1)
What:
- Global flags: --trace, --dry-run, --json, --explain on all commands
- Command Journal: .securamem/journal.jsonl with timestamp, cwd, argv, digests, exit code
- Receipts: .securamem/receipts/<ts>.json for mutating ops (inputs, outputs, counts, hashes)
- “Mirror this” hints: print the exact smem command a human can run
Why: Build trust first, eliminate black‑box behavior, enable audits and reproducibility
How:
- Add a small tracing utility used by CLI handlers
- Wrap DB writes/reads to emit counts and hashes (no schema change required)
- Journal append after command exits; respect --dry-run (write a simulation receipt only)
- Update README with “agent vs human” parity workflows

Transparency & Replay (Glassbox) — Current Status (UPDATED)
- Plan & Mirror: Every core command prints plan and a copy‑pastable mirror line in trace/explain mode
- Dry‑Run by Default (where sensitive): replay defaults to --dry-run; index/search support dry-run
- Receipts v1: Standardized receipts (schema, version, argv, params, resultSummary, success, digests, extras.hybrid, extras.redactions)
- Journal Trail: .codecontextpro/journal.jsonl + receipts/*.json (one per mutating or reporting command)
- Integrity Digests:
  - index-code: fileListDigest (sha256 over considered file list)
  - search-code: resultDigest (sha256 over ordered result IDs and file:line)
  - replay: batch digest over replayed receipt IDs
- Replay UX: normalized mirrors, deduped flags, per-step summaries, safe-by-default replays (batch aggregate line TODO)
- Inspection: cctx receipt-show <idOrPath> pretty-prints receipts

Examples
- Index:
  - cctx index-code --path . --max-chunk 200 --trace --json
  - cctx index-code --path . --max-chunk 200 --trace --explain
- Search:
  - cctx search-code "SymbolName" -k 10 --preview 3 --trace
  - cctx search-code "SymbolName" -k 10 --preview 3 --filter-path src/**/*.ts --trace --json
- Replay:
  - cctx replay --last --trace (dry-run)
  - cctx replay --range 3 --trace (shows incremental summaries)
- Inspect:
  - cctx journal --show
  - cctx receipt-show <id>

Near-term Transparency Roadmap (Refined)
- Final aggregate replay summary line (batch totals)
- Expand explain text to be consistent and concise across all commands
- Add receipt schema v1 to docs with field meanings
- Optionally: cctx receipt-show --last for quick inspection

Acceptance:
- Every mutating command prints Plan, “Mirror this”, and Receipt path
- --dry-run produces identical plan output with no side effects
- cctx journal show lists last N entries with digests; clear with confirmation

2) Code‑Aware Semantic Vector Memory (Tree‑sitter + ANN/sqlite‑vss)
What:
- Parse code into functions/classes/tests/docs with Tree-sitter
- Create embeddings per symbol-level chunk; store in sqlite‑vss FAISS index
- Hybrid search: FTS5 + kNN with simple rank fusion
Why: Function‑level recall increases signal, reduces irrelevant matches
How:
- Extend current CodeIndexer with Tree‑sitter parsers incrementally
- Vendor sqlite‑vss prebuilt binaries; loader already scaffolded; graceful fallback
- Add --semantic flag to search that uses hybrid ranking
Acceptance:
- index-code produces symbol‑scoped chunks with metadata
- search-code --semantic returns better top‑K on function queries (measurable)

2) Zero‑Trust Policy (Memory‑only)
What:
Offline‑strict mode enabled by default; deny all network egress for CodeContextPro features
Allow‑list policy for commands and paths that affect local memory/indexing operations
Full audit: plan → mirror → receipts → journal for all mutating ops
Why: Regulated orgs need least‑privilege, provable no‑egress operation
How:
Policy JSON with allowed commands/globs; doctor and trust helpers
Network guard wrapping http/https to block egress by default
Prove‑offline report: environment checks and guard status
3) Code‑Aware Semantic Vector Memory (Tree‑sitter + FAISS)
What:
Parse code into functions/classes/tests/docs with Tree-sitter
Create embeddings per symbol-level chunk: content + docstring + local call context
FAISS-backed ANN via sqlite-vss for fast, scalable local search
Why: Function-level recall improves signal and reduces irrelevant matches
How:
CodeIndexer pipeline:
Walk repo (ignore node_modules/.git)
Per-language Tree-sitter parser; chunk by symbol; capture file, lang, line range, symbol name, type
Embed to Float32 vectors; store in SQLite (BLOB) and add to sqlite-vss table
Hybrid search:
Combine FTS5 on code text with FAISS kNN on structured vectors
Filters: language, file path, symbol type
Output:
cctx search-code “” → ranked function-level results with file:line and quick preview
4) Air‑Gapped Context (.cctxctx) — CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
Shipped:
- Directory OR zipped bundle (manifest.json, map.csv, vectors.f32, notes.jsonl, checksums.json)
- Optional ed25519 signature (signature.bin + publickey.der) with keyId in manifest
- Per-file SHA256 checksum verification (exit 4 on mismatch)
- Exit codes: 2 unsigned blocked (policy), 3 invalid signature, 4 checksum mismatch
Next:
- Merge/diff preview (Pro) prior to import
- Incremental/delta exports using prior checksums
- Multi-key verification (accept archived keys) + expiry metadata
- Role/path scoped export filters
5) Multi‑Agent Role Memory Profiles (Deferred until after Tree‑sitter + ANN)
What: Role-scoped views of memory based on tags/contexts/paths
Role: SecurityReviewBot → auth, crypto, policy code; excludes UI strings
How:
Policy model: role → include/exclude rules (type, path, language, tags)
CLI: cctx assign-role UXBot ./project/ui/ and cctx role describe UXBot
Enforce at query time and during export (.cctxctx)
Why: Reduces blast radius and cognitive noise; aligns with least privilege
6) Context Replay System (Deferred – keep basic replay only pre‑launch)
What: Reconstruct memory state as of timestamp T to reproduce agent context
How:
Add an append-only event log (create/update/delete/migrate) with content_hash and metadata deltas
cctx replay --at "2025-08-01T12:00:00Z" produces a read-only snapshot and a replay report (which index versions, which memories visible)
Why: Audits and postmortems require reproducibility
Notes:
Store replay indices as temp DBs; do not mutate production
Combine with Zero-Trust audit logs for end-to-end traceability
7) Live Code‑Aware Recall (Post initial launch)
What:
Watch current file in the editor/CLI and bias recall to nearby functions/imports
cctx recall --related-to openFile.js or a background daemon providing suggestions
How:
Editor integration (VS Code): get active file + cursor symbol via LSP/VS Code API
CLI mode: specify file path and optional line range
Enhance ranking with proximity (same file/module) and import graph (optional)
Why: Low-latency, high-relevance recall that follows the developer
8) CLI Shell Embedding (Lower priority pre‑launch)
What:
cctx shell: a memory-enhanced terminal with context-aware autocomplete and #recall
How:
Start a subshell where Tab completion also queries CodeContextPro index
#recall “token” prints snippets ready for paste; no auto-execution
Notes:
Keep Zero-Trust enforcement; no AI-suggested execution unless approved
Position as optional UX feature after core security/FAISS work
9) Secure Agent Middleware Hooks (Enterprise roadmap)
What:
beforePrompt, sanitizeMemory, customEmbedding, memoryMasking hooks
How:
Pluggable middleware pipeline around recall and export
Org policy can lock configuration; hooks run offline
Why: Enterprise needs policy guardrails and extensibility
10) Internal Memory Linter (Post-launch quality sweep)
What: Quality checks and fixes for memory corpus
Rules:
Contradictions: heuristic text checks; flag human review
Outdated: memory older than last file change; suggest reindex
Redundant: near-duplicate content_hash or high cosine similarity
CLI:
cctx lint-memory [--fix redundant] [--report]
Why: Keeps context lean and reliable; reduces hallucination fuel
Roadmap (Phased) — ORIGINAL (for provenance) vs CURRENT adjustments

Deliverables per phase: features, tests, offline verification, admin/operator docs.

Risks and Mitigations
Cross-platform packaging (sqlite-vss, Tree-sitter)
Mitigation: vendor prebuilt binaries for Win/macOS/Linux x64/arm64; robust loader and fallback
Performance on very large repos
Mitigation: chunking strategy, language-aware filters, optional PCA/quantization; background indexing with progress
Policy usability vs safety
Mitigation: defaults to safest mode; policy templates; dry-run previews; audit dashboards
Format stability (.cctxctx)
Mitigation: versioned manifest; backward compatibility layer; integrity checks and signatures
Positioning (non-commercial):
Free, local‑only tool emphasizing privacy, transparency, and high‑quality recall. No licenses, subscriptions, or telemetry.
