# SecuraMem AI Labs — Secure PoC Factory (One‑Pager)

## Problem
Enterprises want AI in back‑office workflows but face data risk, cost of uncertainty, and internal risk aversion.

## Solution
A fixed‑scope, air‑gapped PoC service that delivers a signed, verifiable .smemctx bundle you can run entirely inside your network.

## Why SecuraMem
- Zero‑egress by default; deterministic receipts
- Signed, tamper‑evident bundles; SBOM + checksums
- Reproducible builds; local inference and vector search

## Packages & Timeline
- Discovery (2 weeks): NDA, brief, success criteria, synthetic data plan
- PoC (4–6 weeks): Build on SecuraMem; sign and deliver .smemctx + runbook
- Optional Pilot Hardening (2–4 weeks): auth/logging hooks, deployment docs

## Deliverables
- Signed `.smemctx`, `SHA256SUMS`, verification transcript
- Receipt pack (journal extracts), SBOM, `BUILD-ENV`
- Runbook, Zero‑Egress proof, abridged Threat Model

## Pricing Guidance
- Discovery: $10–25k, PoC: $60–150k, Pilot: $30–80k
- 50–100% PoC credit toward Enterprise annual if signed within 90 days
