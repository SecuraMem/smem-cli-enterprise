Plan and priorities to make SecuraMem a trusted, air‑gapped infra layer — concise, prioritized, and actionable.

Immediate priorities (0–7 days)

Enable native vector backend (FAISS / sqlite‑vss)
Why: huge ANN performance and accuracy benefit vs local‑JS; required for scale.
Next action I can take: install a platform‑matched vss0 binary into .securamem/sqlite-vss/<platform>-<arch>/ and verify with vector-status.
Harden Tree‑sitter coverage and default excludes
Why: avoid noisy fallbacks and index only source files.
Next action I can take: add packaged tree‑sitter parsers (or prebuilt WASM) and add stricter default excludes + tests.
Package offline embedding model(s)
Why: air‑gapped operation needs local models cached under .securamem/models.
Next action: pick a small, permissively licensed model to bundle and add install instructions or CI artifact.
Short term (1–4 weeks) 4) Produce platform artifacts & CI

Why: reproducible, installable releases for Windows/Linux/macOS.
Next action: add CI to build native artifacts (vss0, tree‑sitter parsers) and create release bundles.
Integrity & provenance
Why: trust for air‑gapped operators — verify what they run.
Next action: generate SBOM, sign binaries (code signing or detached signatures), publish checksums and reproducible build steps.
Automated self‑tests & telemetry (opt‑in)
Why: quickly verify that installation works offline.
Next action: add smem self-test and smem vector-status checks; telemetry must be off by default and strictly opt‑in.
Medium term (1–3 months) 7) Security review & third‑party audit

Why: expert review increases trust and helps land higher‑risk customers.
Next action: prepare scope and artifacts for an external audit.
Documentation & onboarding
Why: non‑expert users must be able to deploy air‑gapped stacks reliably.
Next action: create step‑by‑step install guides for air‑gapped installs, release checklist, and quickstart with prebundled artifacts.
Packaging for offline model & binaries distribution
Why: make operator experience repeatable (tar/zip with checksums).
Next action: create release bundles with everything needed for air‑gapped installs.
Longer term (3–6 months) 10) Reproducible builds + supply chain hardening, bug bounty, pilot customers, performance benchmarks and dashboards.

Recommended next step (my suggestion)

I recommend starting with item 1: add a platform‑matched vss0.dll for your Windows x64 workspace and verify vector-status. That gives immediate, high‑impact improvements and lets us iterate on the rest.
