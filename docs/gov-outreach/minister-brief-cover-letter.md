## Cover Brief – For Internal Forwarding
Date: 5 Sept 2025  
From: Jeremy J. Brown (Constituent – Pickering–Uxbridge)  
To: Policy & Digital Innovation Advisors (Ministry of Finance / Treasury Board Secretariat)  
Subject: Secure, Zero‑Egress AI Enablement Pilot – “Made‑in‑Ontario” Platform (SecuraMem + Axiom Ledger exemplar)

### 1. Problem (Current Constraint)
Ontario ministries and regulated financial entities face mounting pressure to apply AI to compliance, reconciliation, auditing, and document intelligence—yet cloud-centric AI workflows risk data egress, chain-of-custody gaps, and uncontrolled model interactions.

### 2. Solution
SecuraMem: an on‑prem / controlled-environment “secure AI memory layer” that allows AI assistants and analytical workflows to operate over sensitive documents without external transmission. Core assurances:  
• Zero network egress by default.  
• Signed, reproducible bundles (verifiable cryptographic packaging).  
• Deterministic receipts / journal for audit & forensic replay.  
• Reproducible builds (supply chain integrity).  

### 3. Immediate Pilot Candidate (Finance Domain)
Axiom Ledger (prototype) – AI‑assisted financial document validation + tamper‑proof journaling of detected anomalies, potential control breaches, and reconciliation events.

Pilot scope (illustrative):  
• Dataset: synthetic / anonymized invoice + contract corpus (no production data in initial phase).  
• Duration: 6 weeks (2 discovery + 4 execution).  
• Output: Signed, offline-verifiable bundle + runbook; measurable efficiency and error detection KPIs.  
• Measures: % anomaly detection improvement; manual review hours reduced; reproducibility verification pass (hash & signature).  

### 4. Policy & Fiscal Alignment
| Goal | Alignment |
|------|-----------|
| Fiscal responsibility | Reduces manual reconciliation / rework cost; improves error interception earlier. |
| Cyber/data protection | Eliminates uncontrolled AI data transmission; auditable memory layer. |
| Ontario innovation | Homegrown secure AI infrastructure; potential export capability. |
| Risk-managed adoption | Small, bounded pilot; cryptographically signed artifacts; reversible footprint. |

### 5. Requested Next Step
Designation of a point-of-contact (Finance digital innovation / TBS digital governance) for a 30‑minute exploratory session (offline verification demo + pilot scoping).

### 6. Materials Available on Request
• Security Evidence Pack (architecture, reproducible builds, audit receipts).  
• Technical signing + verification transcript.  
• Draft pilot SOW (acceptance metrics, data handling).  

Thank you for your consideration.
