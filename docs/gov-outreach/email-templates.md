## 1. Finance Ministry (Minister.Fin@ontario.ca)
Subject: Secure, zero‑egress AI pilot proposal (Finance reconciliation efficiency)

Minister’s Office / Policy Team,

Following constituent outreach acknowledged by the Pickering–Uxbridge office, I’m sharing a concise secure AI pilot proposal (attached). Objective: evaluate a Made‑in‑Ontario platform (SecuraMem + Axiom Ledger exemplar) to reduce manual financial document review time while ensuring zero data egress and full cryptographic auditability.

Request: designate a point-of-contact for a 30‑minute exploratory session (offline verification demo + pilot scoping).

Attachments: Cover Brief, Pilot Proposal.

Thank you,
Jeremy J. Brown (Pickering–Uxbridge)

## 2. Treasury Board Secretariat (minister.tbs@ontario.ca)
Subject: Evaluating reproducible, auditable secure AI pilot (Finance domain exemplar)

Brief introduction: I have proposed to Finance a bounded 6‑week pilot leveraging SecuraMem (zero‑egress AI memory layer) with reproducible builds + deterministic receipts. Requesting TBS involvement to ensure alignment with digital standards / security governance from inception.

Would you identify a suitable digital governance / security architecture contact for a short exploratory session?

Attachments: Cover Brief, Pilot Proposal (focus pages 1–2 for scope overview).

Regards, Jeremy

## 3. Procurement / PBSD (contact form or general)
Subject: Low-risk exploratory secure AI pilot (no production data / signed bundle approach)

Context: Proposed Finance pilot (synthetic data only) – evaluating operational efficiency while retaining full custody (no cloud processing). Seeking early procurement lens to preempt integration frictions if scaled.

Happy to share verification transcript or supply chain evidence pack on request.

Regards, Jeremy
