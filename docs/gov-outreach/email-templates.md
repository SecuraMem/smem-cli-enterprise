# Email Templates – Ontario Government Outreach

All emails concise; attach (or link to) Cover Brief + Pilot Proposal unless stated otherwise.

## 1. Finance Ministry (Minister.Fin@ontario.ca)
Subject: Secure, zero‑egress AI pilot proposal (Finance reconciliation efficiency)

Minister’s Office / Policy Team,

Following constituent outreach acknowledged by the Pickering–Uxbridge office, I’m sharing a concise secure AI pilot proposal (attached). Objective: evaluate a Made‑in‑Ontario platform (SecuraMem + Axiom Ledger exemplar) to reduce manual financial document review time while ensuring zero data egress and full cryptographic auditability.

Request: designate a point-of-contact for a 30‑minute exploratory session (offline verification demo + pilot scoping).

Attachments: Cover Brief, Pilot Proposal.

Thank you,
Jeremy J. Brown (Pickering–Uxbridge)

## 2. Treasury Board Secretariat (minister.tbs@ontario.ca)
Subject: Evaluating reproducible, auditable secure AI pilot (Finance domain exemplar)

Brief introduction: I have proposed to Finance a bounded 6‑week pilot leveraging SecuraMem (zero‑egress AI memory layer) with reproducible builds + deterministic receipts. Requesting TBS involvement to ensure alignment with digital standards / security governance from inception.

Would you identify a suitable digital governance / security architecture contact for a short exploratory session?

Attachments: Cover Brief, Pilot Proposal (focus pages 1–2 for scope overview).

Regards, Jeremy

## 3. Procurement / PBSD (contact form or general)
Subject: Low-risk exploratory secure AI pilot (no production data / signed bundle approach)

Context: Proposed Finance pilot (synthetic data only) – evaluating operational efficiency while retaining full custody (no cloud processing). Seeking early procurement lens to preempt integration frictions if scaled.

Happy to share verification transcript or supply chain evidence pack on request.

Regards, Jeremy

## 4. Follow-Up (Day 7 light nudge)
Subject: Re: Secure AI pilot – checking correct contact

Just confirming the proposal reached the appropriate policy / digital evaluation contact. Happy to redirect or trim further if helpful.

Regards, Jeremy

## 5. Economic Impact Addendum (Day 14)
Subject: Addendum: economic impact & fiscal alignment – secure AI pilot

Sharing a short economic impact brief (attached) outlining efficiency + controlled adoption benefits. Ready to proceed whenever a point-of-contact is assigned.

Regards, Jeremy

## 6. Post-Meeting Summary
Subject: Summary + action items – secure AI pilot exploratory

Thank you for today’s discussion. Action items captured:
1. [Name] – Confirm dataset anonymization approach (by DATE)
2. [Name] – Nominate security review liaison (by DATE)
3. Jeremy – Provide sample verification script package (by DATE)

## Appendix: Refinement Pack (Expanded Drafts & Variants)

This section captures refined language, rationale, alternate subjects, and ultra‑short follow‑ups so you don’t have to rediscover phrasing during outreach waves.

### Improvement Checklist Applied
- Clear referral lead (credibility + context)
- Distilled differentiators: zero‑egress, signed bundles, reproducible builds, deterministic receipts
- Ministry‑specific alignment (Finance = stability & risk; TBS = efficiency & governance; PBSD/Procurement = scalable vendor + low‑risk evaluation)
- Explicit low‑risk framing: synthetic/anonymized data; no procurement commitment in pilot
- Specific, time‑bounded ask: identify contact + 15‑minute intro (availability window included)
- Explicit attachment naming (Cover Brief + Pilot Proposal / One‑Pager as needed)
- Follow‑up cadence support (variants for Day 7 and Day 14)

### Refined Subject Line Options
| Ministry | Primary | Alternate (Short) |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Finance | Referral from MPP Bethlenfalvy – Made‑in‑Ontario Zero‑Egress AI Pilot for Financial Controls | Referral: Secure AI Pilot (Finance Risk & Efficiency) |
| Treasury Board (TBS) | Referral – Secure AI Pilot to Reduce Back‑Office Review Time (6‑Week Bounded) | Referral: Zero‑Egress AI Efficiency Pilot (TBS) |
| PBSD / Procurement | Ontario Vendor Intro – Low‑Risk Secure AI Pilot (Synthetic Data, Signed Bundle) | Ontario Secure AI Vendor – Pilot Intro Request |

### Full Refined Drafts (Long Form)

#### 1. Finance – Long Form
Subject: Referral from MPP Bethlenfalvy – Made‑in‑Ontario Zero‑Egress AI Pilot for Financial Controls

Dear Minister’s Office,

Referred by the constituency office of Hon. Peter Bethlenfalvy. I’m an Ontario founder submitting a brief on SecuraMem—a zero‑egress, signed, reproducible AI memory layer enabling confidential financial document workflows (fraud detection, reconciliation, compliance) without data leaving custody. This supports fiscal prudence (reduced manual review time) and system resilience (verifiable, tamper‑proof audit trail).

Attachments: (1) Cover Brief (one‑page). (2) Pilot Proposal (6‑week bounded; synthetic/anonymized dataset only).

Request: Could you please identify the appropriate policy or cybersecurity contact for a 15‑minute virtual overview next week? Availability: Tue–Thu mornings.

Thank you for your consideration.

#### 2. Treasury Board Secretariat – Long Form
Subject: Referral – Secure AI Pilot to Reduce Back‑Office Review Time (6‑Week Bounded)

Dear Minister’s Office,

Referred by MPP Bethlenfalvy’s constituency office. SecuraMem (Made‑in‑Ontario) provides a zero‑egress, verifiable AI execution model (signed bundles + deterministic receipts) for controlled back‑office automation. Our exemplar (Axiom Ledger) reduces financial document review effort while producing a cryptographically provable journal—aligned with digital standards, audit defensibility, and efficiency mandates.

Attachments: Cover Brief + 6‑Week Pilot Proposal (synthetic/anonymized dataset; no production integration; no procurement commitment).

Request: Kindly direct me to a digital governance / internal audit / transformation lead for a 15‑minute exploratory demo (availability Tue–Thu).

Appreciated,

Name / Title / Contact

#### 3. PBSD / Procurement – Long Form
Subject: Ontario Vendor Intro – Low‑Risk Secure AI Pilot (Synthetic Data, Signed Bundle)

To Whom It May Concern,

Referred by the office of Hon. Peter Bethlenfalvy. SecuraMem is an Ontario secure AI platform enabling ministries to test AI workflows on sensitive data without egress (signed, reproducible, offline‑verifiable bundles). The accompanying “Secure PoC Factory” delivers bounded, synthetic‑data pilots—de‑risking future procurement and shortening security assessment cycles.

Attachments: Cover Brief + Pilot Proposal (6‑week low‑risk evaluation).

Request: Please indicate the appropriate innovation / vendor intake or pre‑procurement evaluation contact for a 15‑minute introduction. Verification transcript or SBOM available on request.

Thank you,

Name / Title / Contact

### Ultra‑Short Follow‑Up Variants (Day 7)
Use same thread (“Re: …”).

Finance:
> Just checking the zero‑egress AI pilot brief (fraud/compliance efficiency) reached the right contact. Synthetic data only; 6‑week bounded. Happy to redirect. Thanks.

TBS:
> Confirming receipt of the reproducible secure AI back‑office pilot (6 weeks, synthetic only). Looking for the right digital governance contact. Many thanks.

Procurement:
> Following up on Ontario secure AI pilot intro (no production data; signed bundle). Could you point me to innovation/vendor intake? Appreciate it.

### Day 14 Economic Impact Addendum Variant
Subject: Addendum: Economic Impact & Fiscal Alignment – Secure AI Pilot

Brief addendum attached summarizing projected review time reduction (≥25%) and anomaly detection uplift (≥15%). Ready to proceed once a point‑of‑contact is assigned.

### Optional Metrics Teaser (Insert After Request If Desired)
Target outcomes: ≥25% manual review time reduction; ≥15% anomaly detection uplift; <30 min independent integrity verification; zero egress events.

### When to Share Evidence Pack
Only after interest / contact designation. Provide: security architecture whitepaper, reproducible builds narrative, receipts/auditability whitepaper, signing transcript excerpt, SBOM sample.

### Internal Tracking Hint
Log each send (timestamp, recipient, subject, attachments) into `.securamem` receipts for provenance if ministries ask for a communication ledger.

### Next Iteration Ideas (Do Not Send Initially)
- Combined 2‑page Policy + Economic Impact Brief
- French (fr-CA) translation for broader circulation
- Verification script walkthrough (appendix PDF) once technical contact engaged

End of refinement pack.
