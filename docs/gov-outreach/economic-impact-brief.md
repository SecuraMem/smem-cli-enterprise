# Economic Impact & Fiscal Alignment Brief
Date: 5 Sept 2025

## Executive Snapshot
SecuraMem + Axiom Ledger can reduce manual financial document reconciliation effort while preserving confidentiality. A conservative phased adoption across provincial finance workflows yields measurable labor hour savings and earlier anomaly interception (cost avoidance).

## Problem Cost Frame (Illustrative)
| Activity | Current Challenge | Cost Vector |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Invoice / contract validation | Manual sampling + spreadsheet cross-checks | Staff time; late error discovery |
| Anomaly investigation | Ad hoc logs; limited provenance | Extended cycle time |
| Assurance / audit prep | Reconstructing evidence manually | Overtime; delay risk |

## Efficiency Model (Illustrative – Pilot Scale)
| Metric | Baseline | Target (Pilot) | Notes |
|--------|----------|----------------|-------|
| Minutes per 50 invoices reviewed | 60 | 45 (‑25%) | Assisted pre-classification |
| Anomalies detected per 1k docs | 40 | 46 (+15%) | Early numeric / structural mismatch flagging |
| Verification time (integrity) | N/A | <30 min | Deterministic script |

## Strategic Benefits
1. Fiscal Responsibility: Shift analyst time from rote checks to exception resolution.  
2. Risk Reduction: Cryptographic receipts provide non-repudiable forensic trail.  
3. Talent Productivity: Modern secure AI tooling aids retention & recruitment.  
4. Repeatability: Template scales horizontally to other ministries with minor adaptation.  
5. Local Economic Development: Validating homegrown secure AI infrastructure supports Ontario innovation narrative.

## Adoption Path (Simplified)
Phase 1 (6 wks) – Pilot (synthetic data).  
Phase 2 (8–10 wks) – Limited production (subset workflows + masked real data).  
Phase 3 – Horizontal expansion (standardized signed bundle process).  
Phase 4 – Continuous improvement (analytics / compliance dashboards layering).

## KPIs to Track
• Review time delta (%)  
• Anomaly detection uplift (%)  
• False positive rate  
• Receipt integrity pass rate  
• Analyst satisfaction (survey)  

## Procurement Acceleration Options
• Treat as innovation / exploratory pilot (non-competitive small value) prior to any scale procurement.  
• Provide pre-built evidence pack – reduces security assessment cycle.  
• Offer signed reproducible build transcript to satisfy supply chain integrity queries early.

## Ask
Identify Finance + TBS digital leads to co-sponsor datasets + evaluation rubric.
