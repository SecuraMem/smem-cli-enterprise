# Pilot Proposal – Secure AI Memory Pilot (Ontario Ministry of Finance)
Version: 1.0 (Draft) – 5 Sept 2025

## 1. Objective
Evaluate SecuraMem’s secure AI memory layer and Axiom Ledger exemplar to quantify operational efficiency gains in financial document validation while maintaining zero data egress and full audit traceability.

## 2. Pilot Scope
| Dimension | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Duration | 6 weeks (2 discovery, 4 execution) |
| Data | Synthetic / anonymized invoice & contract set (curated jointly) |
| Environment | Ministry-controlled workstation or isolated VM (no outbound internet required post-initial provisioning) |
| Deliverable | Signed `.smemctx` bundle + checksum + verification transcript + runbook |
| Functions | Document ingestion, anomaly / mismatch flagging, structured journal, verification script |
| Constraints | No production PII; no integration to live finance systems in pilot phase |

## 3. Success Metrics
Primary:  
• ≥25% reduction in manual review time for sample set (timeboxing baseline vs assisted).  
• ≥15% increase in detection of numeric or contractual mismatches vs control pass.  
• 100% reproducible verification (hash + signature + receipt chain).  
Secondary:  
• <30 minutes to perform independent artifact integrity validation using provided script.  
• Zero network egress events (monitored locally).  

## 4. Methodology
1. Discovery: finalize anonymized data schema; define anomaly categories; confirm acceptance criteria.  
2. Build: implement parsers & anomaly checks; enable journaling receipts; package signed bundle.  
3. Verification: ministry staff execute offline `verify-bundle` script (hash, signature, SBOM diff).  
4. Evaluation: timed review tasks (control vs assisted) + accuracy sampling.  
5. Handover: deliver final metrics report + recommendation pathway.

## 5. Risk & Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Scope expansion mid-pilot | Fixed acceptance criteria; change request defers to post-pilot. |
| Data sensitivity concerns | Use only synthetic/anonymized dataset in pilot. |
| Tool trust skepticism | Provide full signing + receipt evidence pack up front. |
| Resource availability | Pre-schedule checkpoint cadence (weekly) with named stakeholders. |

## 6. Governance & Roles
| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Ministry Pilot Lead | Liaison, dataset approval, scheduling |
| SecuraMem Engineer | Build & package solution |
| SecuraMem Security Lead | Signing + reproducibility verification support |
| Ministry Analyst(s) | Execute timed validation tasks, provide feedback |

## 7. Deliverables
• Signed bundle + SHA256SUMS  
• Verification script + transcript  
• Receipt pack (journal extracts)  
• Metrics & outcome report  
• Optional path-to-production memo (licensing + scaling notes)  

## 8. Post-Pilot Path
If success metrics met: expand to controlled production integration (finance operations), then evaluate cross-ministry domain replication (health billing audit, grant disbursement auditing, procurement compliance).

## 9. Requested Action
Assign point-of-contact & approve anonymized dataset collaboration kickoff (Week 0).
