# Ontario Government Outreach Pack

Purpose: Equip you with concise, ministry-aligned collateral to advance SecuraMem / Axiom Ledger into a provincial pilot (finance + cross‑ministry secure AI enablement).

Contents:
| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| minister-brief-cover-letter.md | Clean 1-page cover tailored for forwarding internally |
| pilot-proposal-ontario-finance.md | 2–page pilot framing (Finance + Treasury Board) |
| economic-impact-brief.md | ROI + cost avoidance + provincial alignment stats |
| meeting-agenda.md | 30‑minute agenda + desired outcomes |
| email-templates.md | Short variants for Minister’s office / Finance / Treasury Board / Procurement |

Suggested Send Order:
1. Reply to constituency aide with thanks + attach Cover Letter + Pilot Proposal (PDF optional).
2. Send tailored concise introduction email to Minister.Fin@ontario.ca referencing constituent outreach already logged; attach Cover + Pilot.
3. Parallel outreach to Treasury Board (governance + digital standards) and PBSD/Procurement (secure deployment angle) with trimmed template.
4. After 5–7 business days: light follow-up with new “Economic Impact” addendum only (no resend of everything) unless they request full deck.

Key Messages (repeat consistently):
1. Zero‑egress secure AI enablement (on‑prem, verifiable bundles, receipts, reproducible builds).
2. Fiscal responsibility: reduce manual reconciliation + error remediation cost (Axiom Ledger exemplar) while safeguarding sensitive data.
3. Made‑in‑Ontario innovation → economic competitiveness + talent retention.
4. Low‑risk evaluation: self‑contained signed pilot bundle; no production data leaves custody.
5. Scalable pattern: finance pilot unlocks repeatable secure AI pattern for other ministries (health, justice, infrastructure).

Immediate Next Actions Checklist:
- [ ] Convert minister-brief-cover-letter.md + pilot-proposal-ontario-finance.md to PDF (optional) for formal routing.
- [ ] Send gratitude + supplemental pack to Adam (constituency aide) referencing earlier call (within 1 business day).
- [ ] Launch direct ministry emails (Finance, Treasury Board) within same window.
- [ ] Log all outreach + timestamps inside `.securamem` receipts (creates provenance if asked who received what, when).
- [ ] Prepare 10‑minute live demo environment (offline verification script + sample secured bundle).
- [ ] Queue follow-up reminder (calendar) at +7 business days.

Success Metrics (early phase):
- Acknowledgment from Finance & TBS policy/digital teams.
- Scheduled exploratory meeting (30 mins) with at least Finance Digital / CFO controller office rep.
- Request for security / technical deep dive (triggers Evidence Pack delivery).
- Agreement in principle to scope a controlled pilot (≤ 60 day window).

Escalation Path if Silent:
Day 0: Initial send.
Day 7: Light nudge (“checking if reached correct contact – happy to redirect”).
Day 14: Provide Economic Impact Addendum + reference AI adoption competitiveness (other provinces / federal momentum).
Day 21: Ask constituency office to confirm correct internal policy advisor alias.

Do NOT (avoid pitfalls):
- Overwhelm with technical annexes early (offer on demand).
- Frame as procurement ask prematurely (keep as exploratory / innovation pilot).
- Use generic “AI transformation” language without tying to verifiable zero‑egress control.

Next wave (prepare only after pilot interest): security annex bundle (SBOM, signing transcript, receipts sample), draft SOW skeleton mapped to provincial data handling / threat model.
